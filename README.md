# WK07

This is the sentence I wanted to use.... it is a simple humourous phrase of manifestation. 

## "I will marry a tall, masculine lovey dovey man who can't breathe when I ignore his existence." 

-- i addded some emojis within the sentence to make it a little fun. 
I originally wanted to add a text font, but i had trouble with making it work in the code. 

I was able to make this code with the help of the video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXJZAXwYFRk

Initially, I had the core structure in place to display individual sentences with different animations and properties, but I wanted it to repeat smoothly and add a dynamic, engaging feel.

I started by setting timed intervals to cycle through the sentences, then realized that using a loop would make it more seamless. After restructuring the code, I integrated a setInterval function to allow each sentence to transition automatically, creating the intended repetitive cycle.

One of the interesting challenges was setting up the dynamic visual properties for each sentence. Adjusting the size, speed, and rotation required experimenting with different values to make each display feel unique and visually engaging - along with color changes within the text. I was able to play around with the bouncy effect by adjusting the size of the text with the random function. I also created a blur effect by adding a slight opacity with the background, which I happened to discover by accident and thought it was a cool effect to keep. I felt it wAs perfect in representing my inner emotional girl rage. 

This process reinforced how sometimes simple adjustmentsâ€”like cycling through an array or adding randomization can make a significant difference in creating an interactive and visually pleasing result.
